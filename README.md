## Description

Writing readmes is repetitive and boring.  So I made a script to do it for you!

## Installation

Readme Generator can be installed by entering the following command in the app's directory:
```
npm install
```

This should install the necessary npm packages and allow the app to run.

## Usage

Once you call the app, you'll be presented with a sequence of Inquirer prompts.  The app takes your answers to generate a readme with markdown styling.  Once you've completed the questions, the readme will be generated in the Output folder.

### Automatic Looping

Certain sections of the readme are extensible, e.g. you can keep adding content until you say you're done.

[Readme Generator allows for an arbitrary number of features before moving on](./Assets/featurelooping.png)
