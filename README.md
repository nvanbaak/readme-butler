## Description

Writing readmes is repetitive and boring.  So I made a script to do it for you!

## Installation

Readme Butler can be installed by entering the following command in the app's directory:
```
npm install
```

This should install the necessary npm packages and allow the app to run.

## Usage

Readme Butler expects your github username as an argument, e.g.:

> node readmeButler.js nvanbaak

You may optionally pass the name of a github repo as a second argument.  Otherwise, Readme Butler will assume it's being called inside your project folder and use the pwd as the repo name.

Once you call the app, you'll be presented with a sequence of Inquirer prompts.  The app takes your answers to generate a readme with markdown styling.  The readme will generate inside the current folder once the questions are answered.

### Automatic Looping

Certain sections of the readme are extensible, e.g. you can keep adding content until you say you're done.

[Readme Butler allows for an arbitrary number of features before moving on](./Assets/featurelooping.png)
