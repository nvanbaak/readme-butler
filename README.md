## Description

Writing readmes is repetitive and boring.  So I made a script to do it for you!

## Installation

Readme Butler can be installed by entering the following command in the app's directory:
```
npm install
```

This should install the necessary npm packages and allow the app to run.

## Usage

Readme Butler expects your github username and the repo as arguments, e.g.:

```
> node readmeButler.js nvanbaak readme-butler
```

Once you call the app, you'll be presented with a sequence of Inquirer prompts.  The app takes your answers to generate a readme with markdown styling.  The readme will generate inside the current folder once the questions are answered.

### Automatic Looping

Certain sections of the readme are extensible, e.g. you can keep adding content until you say you're done.

![Readme Butler allows for an arbitrary number of features before moving on](./Assets/featurelooping.png)
