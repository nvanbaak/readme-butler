## Description

Writing readmes is repetitive and boring.  Readme Butler is a CLI designed to make the process less painful by using the Inquirer npm package to present readme prompts.  Answering a short series of questions is more engaging than doing the whole readme from scratch.

## Installation

Readme Butler can be installed by entering the following command in the app's directory:
```
npm install
```

This should install the necessary npm packages and allow the app to run.

## Usage

Run the project with "node index [your github username]"
